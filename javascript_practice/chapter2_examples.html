    <h1>javascript Examples</h1>
    <p>check the console section of inspect element</p>
    <p>we place elements in the head of your HTML to have them executed before the page loads if you place it in the body then it loads with the webpage</p>
    <p>javascript is used for webpages</p>
    <p>javascript differs form c and c++  in the fact that javascript is dynamic typed which allows variables to change during runtime</p>
    <p>the main difference between var and let is that var is defined globally while let is defined locally</p>
    <p>java applet was a language that was used for webpages but stoped being used becuase of the relience on plugins security reasons and preformace issues</p>
    <P>object element are used provide a way to embed multimedia or other types of content in a web page while offering fallback content for browsers that do not support the embedded resource.</P>
    <p> An expression is any valid set of literals, variables, operators, and expressions that evaluates to a single value.</p>
    <p>You cant mess with the DOM until the page has fully loaded.</p>
